# 7 Days To Die - Experience Rework mod

## Description

This mod changes behaviour of the experience system in the game. By default, the game uses next formula to calculate required experience to reach the next level:

```
exp = 10000 * 1.05^current_lvl
```

In additional, max `current_lvl` limited to 60 for balance reason. But it's to high anyway, for example, to reach level 60 and above you need to get 186792 exp.

This mod changes experience multiplier from 1.05 to 1.02. This value changes the maximum scaling exp to 32800 from level 60 and above.

Compatible and tested with release 1.0.
